/**
 * Centralised translator for Supabase / Postgres errors into text a
 * non-technical user can act on. The reviewer pointed out that we were
 * surfacing `error.message` verbatim in several places — which means the
 * end-user sometimes sees literal strings like
 *
 *   "duplicate key value violates unique constraint
 *    \"team_members_team_user_idx\""
 *
 * or raw `raise exception 'invite_email_mismatch'` payloads. None of
 * those are meaningful outside this codebase.
 *
 * This module maps the well-known error codes / substrings we produce
 * to a human-readable sentence. Unknown errors fall through to the
 * original message so we never swallow information we don't recognise —
 * better an ugly message than a wrong one.
